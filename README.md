# Thiefman
My first C++ project, Thiefman is a hangman-type game with a different premise. You have to guess the word in order to stop Thiefman! The game comes with a list of words related to thievery and stealing. A word is randomly selected for play each time. The game is singleplayer.

## Motivation
I wanted to start off with something simple, yet still with its own charm. I did not want to make the same old hangman game that everyone else makes, so I decided to go with this thief theme. I am pleased with the resulting project as I have just started seriously learning C++!

## What I learned
Getting used to the basic syntax and concepts of C++ was important to me during this project. Using loops, vectors, if/else statements, strings and more, I was able to get a handle on coding concepts in C++. Learning about header files, files for functions, linking, and compiling was very useful as I now have a better understanding of a C++ workflow. Doing research and learning C++ filled me in on the background of C++, where I learned about the C language as well as coding paradigms including C++'s main difference from C: Object Oriented Programming. 

## What I used
I used Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 as my coding environment for C++.
